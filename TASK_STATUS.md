## Reviewer Attention

- UXS-002 R4 is ready for Terra review. All R3 findings reconciled: table footer uses `t("total")`, budget heading no longer duplicates month. Test scope authorized per user Option A (3 test files added to plan).
- User chose Option B (narrowed scope): fireworks.js has both Chinese and Vietnamese barrages; currency-view.js/fx-display.js excluded. Preserve this boundary; no UXS-003 work may start.
- Preserve ADR-003 boundaries: no T011/T012 reconnect, no general transaction/account migration, no English UI, and no external notifications.
