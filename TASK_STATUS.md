## Reviewer Attention

- UXS-002 is ready for the DeepSeek V4 Flash Coder. Terra must stop until the state is `READY_FOR_REVIEW`.
- UXS-002 establishes Vietnamese-first i18n: all reachable user-facing strings from message keys, default vi, switchable zh-CN, no English.
- Prohibited: modifying entries/settings schema, amount/date rules, Firebase paths, real data, or design refactoring.
- Preserve ADR-003 boundaries: no T011/T012 reconnect, no general transaction/account migration, no English UI, and no external notifications.
